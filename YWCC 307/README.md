INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATION
JULIAN HAME - 11/10/2022
========================

The "individual presentation" was a solo endeavour meant to educate my audience about 3D printing optimization.
It specifically focuses on 3D printing material options and topology optimization and how they tie in with optimizing prints.

The presentation is split into four different parts which cover the two topics in detail:
  1 - Introduction: This section defines the resources required for printing and explains what topology optimization is.
  2 - Factors: This section describes how different materials and infill/thickness options may affect a print.
  3 - Optimal Approaches: This section explains what the best material/infill/shell options are and why.
  4 - Conclusion: This section recaps the preceding slides and offers audience questions.
